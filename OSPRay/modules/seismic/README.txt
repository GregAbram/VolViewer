    Description:

        A file loader for seismic volume data based on the FreeDDS library.

    FreeDDS:

       "The Data Dictionary System is an I/O System (and much more) capable of
        handling multi-dimensional seismic datasets (up to 9 dimensions; e.g.
        'axis = t offset shot x y') in various formats including usp (BP Amoco's
        Un*x Seismic Processing), segy (Society of Exploration Geophysicists
        SEG-Y format), segy1 (SEG's SEG-Y Rev 1.0 format), sep (Stanford
        Exploration Project's format), su (Colorado School of Mine's Seismic
        Un*x format) as well as other flexible trace definitions (with or without
        trace headers) such as fcube.  DDS allows different processing systems to
        be used together by piping directly together as well as through actual
        emulation of different processing systems."
